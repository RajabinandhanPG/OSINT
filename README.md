Welcome to OSNIT Dashboard!

OSNIT Dashboard is a user-friendly GUI application that allows you to scrape and retrieve information from various social media platforms. With just a few clicks, you can easily retrieve data from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and use it for any purpose you desire.

Getting started with OSNIT Dashboard is easy. Simply download the code from our GitHub repository and run it on your local machine. The application is built using Python and the Tkinter library, so you will need to have those installed before running the code.

Once you have the application up and running, you will see a clean and simple interface. There are three tabs labeled "Twitter," "Facebook," and "Instagram," each corresponding to the respective social media platform. To retrieve information from any of these platforms, simply enter the username of the profile you want to scrape in the designated text box and click the appropriate button.

For Twitter, you can get information about the user or scrape their followers' information or tweets. For Facebook, you can get information about the user, and for Instagram, you can get information about the user's profile.

The application is designed to be easy to use, even for those who are not experienced with coding or scraping data. The user interface is clean and intuitive, and the buttons are labeled clearly, making it easy to know what actions they will perform.

At OSNIT, we take security and privacy seriously. The application does not collect or store any data from the user, and all scraping is done locally on your machine. We recommend that you use the scraped data ethically and in accordance with the terms of service of the social media platforms.

We hope that you find OSNIT Dashboard useful in your social media scraping endeavors. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact us. Happy scraping!
